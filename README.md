# hh-composition
Calibrates the age composition of households by (a) age of household head, and (b) income percentile group, smoothed with kernel density estimation. Currently based on [tax unit data](https://github.com/PSLmodels/taxdata/blob/master/cps_data/pycps/cps.csv.gz) produced from the Current Population Survey March Supplement via the `taxdata` project. Used for computing universal basic incomes in the [OG-USA](http://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA) overlapping generations macroeconomic model.
